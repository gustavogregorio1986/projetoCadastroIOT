# File server

## Project page
Exchange of photos and multimedia files on board. See the 
[web page](https://sites.google.com/site/olewsaa/yacht-server/file-server---network-file-system-nfs) about the file server for some more information.


## Background 
Very often files and photos need to be shared and exchanged. This project sets up a very small file server using Bluetooth, SAMBA, NFS and sshFS/SFTP to enable laptops, phones and pads to upload, download, share and exchange photos, music and other files.

## Implementation

Connection over wifi and bluetooth for mobile phones. Wifi require an app like andSMB to be installed, while bluetooth 
just works witout any extra app installed. 

It's also an option to connect a laptop via an ethernet cable and use an adhoc network. This needed to  enter 
SSID and password into the orangepi.
