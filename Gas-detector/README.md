# Gas detector / monitor

## MQ gas sensors

The MQ series of gas sensors is the backbone of this project. Spanning a range of gases these sensors can cover the most relevant gases one might to monitor onboard, Propane/Butane and Carbon Monoxide. 

An overview of sensors are given [here](https://www.mysensors.org/build/gas). From this list it's evident that MQ2 and MQ9 are the most relevent onboard, the web page also point to data sheets. MQ2 is sensitive to light hydrocarbons and smoke while MQ9 is sensitive to flameable gases and Carbon monoxide. 

The sketch provied is a test to start work with the sensors. It runs on a Nano board. It's in early development stage.
